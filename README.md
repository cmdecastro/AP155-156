# Applied Physics 155 and 156 - Computer Methods in Physics I and II
This repository contains select programs I coded for the activities in my undergraduate class in Computer Methods in Physics I and II. 

Each Jupyter Notebook contains the theoretical framework (equations and discussions) behind each activity. 
There are also short discussion on how to obatin each figure/plot and what each of them means. 

Each activity aims to recreate some of the figures in certain sections/chapters in the book Physics by Computer by Kinzel and Reents. 
The discussions and theoretical framework are also based in said book.
